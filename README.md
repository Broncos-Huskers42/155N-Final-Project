# 155N-Final-Project
Final project for CSCE 155N over summer 2020 

##How to Reproduce the Results of the code
    Funtion Names:
        1) plotEfficiencyVsPowerIn
            a) Requires input from 4 different parameters
                  i) C0, C1, C2, and xLim (a two dimensional array vector is needed here)
                  
        2) plotEnduranceVsFuelCapacity
            a) Requires input from 4 different parameters
                  i) P (engine power), Te (thermal efficiency), Ge (gasoline energy), xLim (a two dimensional array vector is needed here)
